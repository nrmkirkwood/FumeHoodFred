# FRED
A simple RPi retrofit device which mitigates emissions from fumehoods in research labs.

# For a simple FRED (recommended): 

Use the 'fhf-basic code' with a RPi Pico (no wifi required) and the 'fhf-base' + 'fhf-lid' STL files to 3D print a case (or make your own). 

You will also need a power supply, cable, at least one buzzer, and a reed switch sensor (aka door switch sensor).

Details are in the "FRED how-to" word document.

See my blog post at https://nrmkirkwood.github.io/projects/fumehoodfred/ for photos of the setup.
